### Ethan's Poetry

Hello! This will be the repository for a website that showcases short poetry written almost daily by Ethan

The website is a Vanilla JavaScript site that uses API calls to get different poetry each time, so the site stays as fresh as possible. This is also because different poetry will appear depending on what level of a reader your account is.

This is a low-level security website, so feel free to use a short and simple username and password you'll remember.
